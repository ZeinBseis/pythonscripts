# Assignment

I/O, i.e., reading data from and writing data to the external world,
is a core aspect of scripting. Typical examples are files and network sockets.

Let's start simple. Write a script `print.py` that
reads the contents of the file named `filename` and prints it.
You'll have to [look online](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+read+file+to+string) for
how to do this. It's strongly recommended you find a piece of code that
relies on the `with` construct.

The script should be used as follows:

```bash
$ python print-file.py FILE
```

If you are running your solution in your working folder, you could pass your own script or the explanations file to your solution as test file.
