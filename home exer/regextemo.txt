pattern = re.compile("^[a-z]{3} [0-9]{3,5} [^a-zA-Z0-9]{1}[A-Z]{0,2}$")


^ asserts the start of the string.
[a-z]{3} matches exactly three lowercase letters from a to z.
matches a single space character.
[0-9]{3,5} matches a sequence of three to five digits (0-9).
matches a single space character.
[^a-zA-Z0-9]{1} matches any single character that is not an alphanumeric character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).
[A-Z]{0,2} matches zero to two uppercase letters from A to Z.
$ asserts the end of the string.

Here are some examples of strings that would match this pattern:

"abc 123 xyz"
"def 9876 !A"
"xyz 54321 $"
